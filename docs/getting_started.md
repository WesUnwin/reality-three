## Getting started

TThe best way to way to create a new project is by using the <a href="https://wesunwin.github.io/three-game-engine/#/editor">Scene Editor</a> and clicking "New Project" at the top of the right-hand sidebar. This will boilerplate a new project folder.

See the documentation on running the scene editor.

Its recommended to the use git or git with large file storage (if needed) to version control and backup your project.

You can choose to not use the scene editor, and manually set up a web app and directly use three-game-engine also:

three-game-engine is made available as an npm package that you can install via npm or yarn:

```
  npm install --save three-game-engine

  or 

  yarn add three-game-engine
```
