## The Scene Editor
This game engine comes with a useful scene editor that allows you to create and edit all the
scenes of your game.

The scene editor is entirely optional, anything you can do with the scene editor can be done by manually creating and editing .json files.

The scene editor makes it easy to compose and initialize scenes and see how things look before running a game. You can also use the scene editor to quickly start a new project.

You can use the [online scene editor](https://wesunwin.github.io/three-game-engine/#/editor)

OR

You can run the scene editor locally (offline) by:
```
  git clone git@github.com:WesUnwin/three-game-engine.git
  cd three-game-engine
  npm install
  npm run scene_editor  # Will automatically open a tab in your browser
```
