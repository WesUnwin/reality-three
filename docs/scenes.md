## Scenes
Scenes are arrangements of GameObjects to create meaningful areas like levels, rooms, etc. within your game. Each scene has a name (a string), and a Scene JSON file describing the layout and composition of game objects.

Scenes are best created and edited using the scene editor, but you can also manually edit scene .json files if prefered.
