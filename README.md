## About The Project

The vision:
* To provide a web-first game engine, for developers that love javascript/typescript (but with support for building desktop and mobile apps)
* to offer a 100% free engine that can be used by anyone to build personal or comercial apps/games.
* maintain source code that is highly readable, and extendable
* to offer VR support

### Built With

This library simply ties together several well known, capable javascript libraries resulting in a powerful yet simple game engine. Dependencies are minimal and fully open-source.

* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three) - a 3D WebGL-based Graphics Engine
* [Rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier.js) - a 3D Physics Engine
* [three-mesh-ui](https://github.com/felixmariotto/three-mesh-ui) - Lets you build 3D user interfaces in Three.js

## Architecture
This game engine allows you to manage a Scene of GameObjects.
Each GameObject controls a Group in the ThreeJS scene graph, and can optionally be associated with a Rapier RigidBody with colliders.

## Scene Editor

This game engine comes with a well-equiped scene editor that allows you to compose scenes with game objects.

Your game and scenes are described by a project folder containing .json files that can be manually edited or opened in the scene editor.

The scene editor also allows you to quickly boilerplate a new project also.

You can run the scene editor locally by cloning this repo and:
```sh
  npm install
  npm run scene_editor
```

OR

Use the online scene editor [here](https://wesunwin.github.io/three-game-engine/#/editor)

## Desktop and Mobile Apps
In addition to using this library to build web apps that run in your browser, 
with third party tools like electron, cordova, etc. you can easily package and 
distribute your game as a desktop app or mobile app.

This repo contains complete working examples of:
- How to use electron & electron-forge to package your game as a desktop app,
  see [examples/electron](https://github.com/WesUnwin/three-game-engine/tree/main/examples/electron)
- How to package your app as an android or iOS app using Apache Cordova,
  see [examples/cordova](https://github.com/WesUnwin/three-game-engine/tree/main/examples/cordova)
